## Conclusion and Personal Take on this project

-- I coded this with pure HTML, CSS, and JS <br>
-- For the chart functionality, I used ChartJS for charting framework <br>
-- I stored the dummy data on a JSON variable, which you can find inside the <script></script> tags... <br>
-- This won't be possible with the help of my senpai and ChatGPT... <br>
-- Soon, I will make this in a ReactJS version!
